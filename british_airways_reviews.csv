1,Trip Verified,"✅  |   Flew with British Airways club Europe on Saturday 31st August. Poor lounge in Berlin Brandenburg airport. Emailed, to say that flight was delayed with no explanation, and no announcement made. Staff in lounge had not been told of delay, and airport info screens were not updated. Email said to keep checking online for updates. Flight took over 99 minutes late with no explanation why the late arrival of plane and departure, with a very rushed service. On arrival at LHR, quickly with passport control, then an almost hour wait for baggage to arrive on the carousels. No announcements due to the delay, meaning arriving home over 3 hours later than should of been arriving.",2,2024-09-01,Business,Business Class,3,1,1,,3,,1,no
2,Trip Verified,✅  |   Straightforward check in T5. New site for club check in and it works well. All lounges busy but good food offerings. On time departure for a completely full flight in all cabins. Sound food and drink offered with the exception of inferior quality champagne. Crew coped well for this busy and quite short flight.

3,Not Verified,"I am beyond upset and disgusted with the disregard, lack of knowledge and lies that your company has put me through. Each call I have had with a different representative has lead to no help, nothing being resolved and false information. Due to no longer being able to fly for my original flight, I called and spoke to someone who gave me a new reference number where I could book at a later date/destination or change the name. I then had a close family member pass away suddenly to which I then offered my mother my ticket to fly out for the funeral, as I was told I could change the name. When then calling and trying to do this, I then got told that I was unable to do this unless we proved this by sending the death certificate as stated in the ‘policy’. After questioning this and not wanting to get false information, I made this representative double check and confirm this to which she did. After then troubling my aunt and uncle, who are grieving over the sudden loss of their son (my cousin) for this documentation, we then sent it to the to email provided and called to get this now changed into my mothers name. To which we then found out was yet ANOTHER lie and that this cannot be done as you can only change the name if the ticket holder has passed away (which makes no sense as they would be dead so how can they challenge a name change.) After expressing my feelings of mistrust, that I would be taking it further as I no longer wanting to have anything to do with this company, I was told that I wasn’t allowed any refund and was only allowed to book it at a later date. I then challenged the representative to speak to a manger to which I was told, they had none working, they had gone home and that no one had any direct email. After then putting in a formal complaint 5 MONTHS AGO WITH STILL NO RESPONSE. I called back to use the money to book a new flight to say I couldn't as it was a less amount (even after saying fine keep the remaining money) and I was only allowed to book the same amount or more (scam to get more money out of you). When asking to speak to a manager, shock horror, there isn't one working. When looking at the status of my complaint he said there is a back log and will get to it eventually (says a lot if the back log of complaints is longer than 5 months). To then be told there is nothing he can do. I am beyond appalled, hurt and frustrated by this whole experience and will be spreading the word and my story to every known platform and review website possible till I speak to someone who, genuinely knows what they are talking about and can come to a mutual agreement/resolve the issue as, the information I was told only leaves me to believe that this company doesn’t care AT ALL about its customers and only cares about money and profit.",1,2024-08-28,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,,1,no
4,Trip Verified,"✅  |   I purchased round trip direct flight business class ticket for my family from Hong Kong to London. A few days before the trip, the airline cancelled our return flight without giving any reasons and booked us on a flight routing via Doha which gave us 2 hour layover. On the day of departure, the flight was delayed by more than 2 hours as a result of ""crew shortage"". When getting on the flight, we enquired about whether we'd be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the Doha to Hong Kong flight would wait. When we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was 6 hours later. We had to wait 1 hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel. After the flight we reached out to make a complaint and ask for monetary consideration given the experience, the airline has not responded for more than a month.

A few days before the trip, the airline cancelled our return flight without giving any reasons and booked us on a flight routing via Doha which gave us 2 hour layover.

When getting on the flight, we enquired about whether we'd be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the Doha to Hong Kong flight would wait. When we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was 6 hours later. We had to wait 1 hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel. After the flight we reached out to make a complaint and ask for monetary consideration given the experience, the airline has not responded for more than a month. We paid up for the direct flight and premium seating, but the experience was overall very poor.",1,2024-08-28,Family Leisure,Business Class,4,1,1,4,3,4,1,no

I then had a close family member pass away suddenly to which I then offered my mother my ticket to fly out for the funeral, as I was told I could change the name. When then calling and trying to do this, I then got told that I was unable to do this unless we proved this by sending the death certificate as stated in the ‘policy’. After questioning this and not wanting to get false information, I made this representative double check and confirm this to which she did. After then troubling my aunt and uncle, who are grieving over the sudden loss of their son (my cousin) for this documentation, we then sent it to the to email provided and called to get this now changed into my mothers name. To which we then found out was yet ANOTHER lie and that this cannot be done as you can only change the name if the ticket holder has passed away (which makes no sense as they would be dead so how can they challenge a name change.) After expressing my feelings of mistrust, that I would be taking it further as I no longer wanting to have anything to do with this company, I was told that I wasn’t allowed any refund and was only allowed to book it at a later date. I then challenged the representative to speak to a manger to which I was told, they had none working, they had gone home and that no one had any direct email. After then putting in a formal complaint 5 MONTHS AGO WITH STILL NO RESPONSE. I called back to use the money to book a new flight to say I couldn't as it was a less amount (even after saying fine keep the remaining money) and I was only allowed to book the same amount or more (scam to get more money out of you). When asking to speak to a manager, shock horror, there isn't one working. When looking at the status of my complaint he said there is a back log and will get to it eventually (says a lot if the back log of complaints is longer than 5 months). To then be told there is nothing he can do. I am beyond appalled, hurt and frustrated by this whole experience and will be spreading the word and my story to every known platform and review website possible till I speak to someone who, genuinely knows what they are talking about and can come to a mutual agreement/resolve the issue as, the information I was told only leaves me to believe that this company doesn’t care AT ALL about its customers and only cares about money and profit.",1,2024-08-28,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,,1,no

A few days before the trip, the airline cancelled our return flight without giving any reasons and booked us on a flight routing via Doha which gave us 2 hour layover. On the day of departure, the flight was delayed by more than 2 hours as a result of ""crew shortage"". When getting on the flight, we enquired about whether we'd be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the Doha to Hong Kong flight would wait. When we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was 6 hours later. We had to wait 1 hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel.

When getting on the flight, we enquired about whether we'd be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the Doha to Hong Kong flight would wait. When we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was 6 hours later. We had to wait 1 hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel. After the flight we reached out to make a complaint and ask for monetary consideration given the experience, the airline has not responded for more than a month.

I then had a close family member pass away suddenly to which I then offered my mother my ticket to fly out for the funeral, as I was told I could change the name. When then calling and trying to do this, I then got told that I was unable to do this unless we proved this by sending the death certificate as stated in the ‘policy’. After questioning this and not wanting to get false information, I made this representative double check and confirm this to which she did. After then troubling my aunt and uncle, who are grieving over the sudden loss of their son (my cousin) for this documentation, we then sent it to the to email provided and called to get this now changed into my mothers name. To which we then found out was yet ANOTHER lie and that this cannot be done as you can only change the name if the ticket holder has passed away (which makes no sense as they would be dead so how can they challenge a name change.) After expressing my feelings of mistrust, that I would be taking it further as I no longer wanting to have anything to do with this company, I was told that I wasn’t allowed any refund and was only allowed to book it at a later date. I then challenged the representative to speak to a manger to which I was told, they had none working, they had gone home and that no one had any direct email. After then putting in a formal complaint 5 MONTHS AGO WITH STILL NO RESPONSE. I called back to use the money to book a new flight to say I couldn't as it was a less amount (even after saying fine keep the remaining money) and I was only allowed to book the same amount or more (scam to get more money out of you). When asking to speak to a manager, shock horror, there isn't one working. When looking at the status of my complaint he said there is a back log and will get to it eventually (says a lot if the back log of complaints is longer than 5 months). To then be told there is nothing he can do. I am beyond appalled, hurt and frustrated by this whole experience and will be spreading the word and my story to every known platform and review website possible till I speak to someone who, genuinely knows what they are talking about and can come to a mutual agreement/resolve the issue as, the information I was told only leaves me to believe that this company doesn’t care AT ALL about its customers and only cares about money and profit.",1,2024-08-28,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,,1,no

A few days before the trip, the airline cancelled our return flight without giving any reasons and booked us on a flight routing via Doha which gave us 2 hour layover. On the day of departure, the flight was delayed by more than 2 hours as a result of ""crew shortage"". When getting on the flight, we enquired about whether we'd be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the Doha to Hong Kong flight would wait. When we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was 6 hours later. We had to wait 1 hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel.

When getting on the flight, we enquired about whether we'd be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the Doha to Hong Kong flight would wait. When we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was 6 hours later. We had to wait 1 hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel. After the flight we reached out to make a complaint and ask for monetary consideration given the experience, the airline has not responded for more than a month.

I then had a close family member pass away suddenly to which I then offered my mother my ticket to fly out for the funeral, as I was told I could change the name. When then calling and trying to do this, I then got told that I was unable to do this unless we proved this by sending the death certificate as stated in the ‘policy’. After questioning this and not wanting to get false information, I made this representative double check and confirm this to which she did. After then troubling my aunt and uncle, who are grieving over the sudden loss of their son (my cousin) for this documentation, we then sent it to the to email provided and called to get this now changed into my mothers name. To which we then found out was yet ANOTHER lie and that this cannot be done as you can only change the name if the ticket holder has passed away (which makes no sense as they would be dead so how can they challenge a name change.) After expressing my feelings of mistrust, that I would be taking it further as I no longer wanting to have anything to do with this company, I was told that I wasn’t allowed any refund and was only allowed to book it at a later date. I then challenged the representative to speak to a manger to which I was told, they had none working, they had gone home and that no one had any direct email. After then putting in a formal complaint 5 MONTHS AGO WITH STILL NO RESPONSE. I called back to use the money to book a new flight to say I couldn't as it was a less amount (even after saying fine keep the remaining money) and I was only allowed to book the same amount or more (scam to get more money out of you). When asking to speak to a manager, shock horror, there isn't one working. When looking at the status of my complaint he said there is a back log and will get to it eventually (says a lot if the back log of complaints is longer than 5 months). To then be told there is nothing he can do. I am beyond appalled, hurt and frustrated by this whole experience and will be spreading the word and my story to every known platform and review website possible till I speak to someone who, genuinely knows what they are talking about and can come to a mutual agreement/resolve the issue as, the information I was told only leaves me to believe that this company doesn’t care AT ALL about its customers and only cares about money and profit.",1,2024-08-28,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,,1,no
794,Trip Verified,"✅  |   I purchased round trip direct flight business class ticket for my family from Hong Kong to London. A few days before the trip, the airline cancelled our return flight without giving any reasons and booked us on a flight routing via Doha which gave us 2 hour layover. On the day of departure, the flight was delayed by more than 2 hours as a result of ""crew shortage"". When getting on the flight, we enquired about whether we'd be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the Doha to Hong Kong flight would wait. When we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was 6 hours later. We had to wait 1 hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel.

When getting on the flight, we enquired about whether we'd be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the Doha to Hong Kong flight would wait. When we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was 6 hours later. We had to wait 1 hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel. After the flight we reached out to make a complaint and ask for monetary consideration given the experience, the airline has not responded for more than a month.

Each call I have had with a different representative has lead to no help, nothing being resolved and false information. Due to no longer being able to fly for my original flight, I called and spoke to someone who gave me a new reference number where I could book at a later date/destination or change the name. I then had a close family member pass away suddenly to which I then offered my mother my ticket to fly out for the funeral, as I was told I could change the name. When then calling and trying to do this, I then got told that I was unable to do this unless we proved this by sending the death certificate as stated in the ‘policy’. After questioning this and not wanting to get false information, I made this representative double check and confirm this to which she did. After then troubling my aunt and uncle, who are grieving over the sudden loss of their son (my cousin) for this documentation, we then sent it to the to email provided and called to get this now changed into my mothers name. To which we then found out was yet ANOTHER lie and that this cannot be done as you can only change the name if the ticket holder has passed away (which makes no sense as they would be dead so how can they challenge a name change.) After expressing my feelings of mistrust, that I would be taking it further as I no longer wanting to have anything to do with this company, I was told that I wasn’t allowed any refund and was only allowed to book it at a later date.

After then putting in a formal complaint 5 MONTHS AGO WITH STILL NO RESPONSE. I called back to use the money to book a new flight to say I couldn't as it was a less amount (even after saying fine keep the remaining money) and I was only allowed to book the same amount or more (scam to get more money out of you). When asking to speak to a manager, shock horror, there isn't one working. When looking at the status of my complaint he said there is a back log and will get to it eventually (says a lot if the back log of complaints is longer than 5 months).

I am beyond appalled, hurt and frustrated by this whole experience and will be spreading the word and my story to every known platform and review website possible till I speak to someone who, genuinely knows what they are talking about and can come to a mutual agreement/resolve the issue as, the information I was told only leaves me to believe that this company doesn’t care AT ALL about its customers and only cares about money and profit.",1,2024-08-28,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,,1,no

A few days before the trip, the airline cancelled our return flight without giving any reasons and booked us on a flight routing via Doha which gave us 2 hour layover.

When getting on the flight, we enquired about whether we'd be able to make the flight and we were told that given many passengers are on the same flight the Doha to Hong Kong flight would wait. When we arrived we were told that our flight already departed and the next flight available was 6 hours later. We had to wait 1 hour to get our boarding passes and then was only given access to the lounge when there is an airport hotel.
